# **Pizza sales analysis with Power BI and SQL**
In this project, we analyzed data from sales of a pizza store in 2015.  SQL queries were used to calculate KPIs and other important data relating to those sales, and then Power BI was used to create a dashboard 
to visualize those values. The data-related questions answered in this project are the following:

* What are the total revenue, average order cost, average number of pizzas per order,  total orders, and total pizzas sold?
* How many pizzas were ordered each day of the week and month?
* What are the percentages of pizzas sold by type and size?
* What are the total orders for each category of pizza?
* What are the top and bottom 5 types of pizza by revenue?

## SQL Queries
The image below shows some of the rows contained in the table that we will be working on. As we can observe, the dataset consists of historical data on pizza sales carried out in 2015. We have information such 
as the date of the order, the size of the pizza, the number of pizzas ordered, the category of pizza, etc.
